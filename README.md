# Egg_Hatcher

**Description**

Egg Hatcher will be an online game and social experiment based off [The Button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Button_(Reddit)).

The website displays a chicken and two buttons. One button has the chicken lay an egg and the egg is displayed on the screen, while the other button hatches all the eggs. The goal is to see who can hatch the most eggs at once. Each player can only press one button every 60 seconds, so there is tension when the player is trying to count the eggs on the screen to decide if they should lay another egg or hatch all the eggs for themselves. A user can register so that they can keep track of the most eggs they've peronsally hatched. There will also be a leaderboard to see who has hatched the most eggs out of everyone who has played the game.
